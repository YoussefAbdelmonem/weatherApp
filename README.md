here is the prototype that i use for applying the clean architecture 
I learnd this from a udemy course called : Flutter Clean Architecture [2022] [Flutter 3] (In Arabic)

for the API :

I got the API code from openweathermap

and here is the link  to the website: https://openweathermap.org/current

And the final result is:
